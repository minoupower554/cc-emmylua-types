# ComputerCraft EmmyLua types

#### this is an unofficial repository providing EmmyLua type definitions for ComputerCraft and related mods. i add definitions as i need them in in-game scripts so don't rely on this being complete

## How to use
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't already
2. Open the project in VSCode and install the recommended extensions that VSCode prompts you to. If it doesn't prompt you click on Extensions in the left sidebar, type in "sumneko.lua" and install the extension
3. Copy all the files of the project into a subdirectory called for example `types`
4. Create a lua file in the current directory
5. Then just put `require('types')` at the top of the file and you are good to go
